		<h3 class="me">My name is Ryan Richard Wilkins and I am currently a full-time student at DevBootcamp in San Francisco, CA. I was born and raised in Petaluma, CA (the original P-Town!). Eventually I grew up and got tired of my small town so when I got accepted to the University of Southern California, I did not hesitate to pursue a new adventure in Los Angeles. I majored in Theatre and tried to be an actor for about 7 years. After spending a lot of money on self marketing, classes and doing small projects here and there I decided the business of acting was not for me and I came back to my home town to find a new career. Finally after a couple years of trying different things, I believe I am on track to find the career I have been looking for with coding.

		<h3 class="me">Coding seems to fit perfectly with my lifestyle and hobbies. I have always been interested in computers but never really delved too deep into computer science until now. Most of my computer experience comes from gaming(I am a proud level 100 Tauren Paladin named "Bulldose" on World of Warcraft). Then I started to learn how to custome build PCs. Learning about the hardware was fun so it felt natural to delve deeper into the software. Outside of computers and gaming my other hobbies involve the outdoors. I am a huge sports fan. I love watching all sports GO WARRIORS! but I also love playing. I was a co-captain for my college Ultimate Frisbee team, but today you will usually find me playing <a href="http://www.wallyball.com/" alt="Wallyball">WallyBall</a>(this is Volley Ball played inside a racquetball court) or tennis. </h3>
