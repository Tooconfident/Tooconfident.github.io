What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge? - Margins are the space outside a css element. Borders are the edge of the element and padding is the space between the content and border. Usually if you increase the padding, it will expand the border. Margins seem to be the most important element to focus on when positioning objects in css.

What did you learn about CSS positioning? - There are four types of positioning, static, fixed, absolute, and relative. Static is the exact location of an object and is the default position. Absolute makes an element's positioin relative to the other elements in the code. Relative is the position of an element relative to itself and fixed keeps an element in place and will not move regardless of scrolling through a page.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult? - Nothing was necessarily easy for me but I found font-size and anything involving font to be pretty straight forward. The hardest part was positioning for sure. It is very hard to understand which form of position is the correct one and it just takes a lot of time, trial and error to figure it out.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge? - Adding classes and id's as well as implementing parent child relationships with CSS made it much easier to keep track of style changes that we're implemented. I also learned that you can link multiple style sheets to one page and that makes creating more changes even easier.
