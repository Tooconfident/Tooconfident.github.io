    <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
    <h2>A Dive into the Blueprint of Ruby Objects</h2>
    <h4>February 28th, 2016</h4>
  
    <section class="paragraphs">
      <p>
        This week Dev Bootcamp put us through the Ruby-ringer(#coin_phrase)! We went way deeper into the language with particular focus on Classes. I mentioned a couple weeks ago about Arrays and Hashes and how they are classes.  Well this week we're going a little deeper on exactly what a class is, and how we can create one of our own! I feel Classes are one of the things that really show off what Ruby can do. I'm sure you've had some people talk to you and teach you some basic html elements and some intructors enjoy describing the html language as having a "tree-like" structure. Well we can look at Ruby in a very similar way not just in how it's structured with syntax but with how the objects inside actually communicate with each other. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A Class is a blueprint that contains objects inside it. As everything in the Ruby language is an object, this is pretty vague, but bare with me. We know about methods and variables in Ruby already, so if a Class contains these, think of the Class as a parent, and the objects, its children. Now that I think of it, sticking with the idea of a tree and family, let's actually use a 'Family Tree' as a fun example of how Ruby Classes work.
      </p>
        <pre class="code">
        <code>
            class StarkFamily 
              def initialize(name, age, title)
                @name = name
                @age = age
                @title = title
              end
            end
        </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        So above we have identified a Class "StarkFamily". Every class begins with this initialize stage(method), the starting 'instance' of the Class. This method shows three instance variables that are meant to identify the attributes of a member of the <a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones" alt="GoT">Stark</a> family. Instance variables are like local variables except instead of only being accessible within the method they are created(local variables), they can be accessed within an instance of a class. This allows instance methods to be able to use the same variables and communicate with each other. The way you identify an instance variable is when it has the <code>'@'</code> symbol before it. If we can determine that instance variables are used anywhere within the class they are defined, then we can then say the same for instance methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, so say we want to use this StarkFamily tree Class to identify different members of the Starks and keep a log of whose who. Well those instance variables are a start and we're going to use them to add members of the family to keep track of. First we start with defining basic instance methods to keep track of three attributes.
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
        <code>
          class StarkFamily
            def initialize(name, age, title)
              @name = name
              @age = age
              @title = title
            end
          
            def name
              @name
            end

            def age
              @age
            end

            def title
              @title
            end
          end
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
      Ok wait, this is already getting really repetetive, but unfortunately we do have to define what these instance variables are to continue to use them throughout the class and to be able to call on them outside the instances of the class. Well we're in luck because within Ruby, like most programming languages, there is usually a simpler and cleaner way to do something. I give you the <code>attr_</code> attribute and it looks something like this.
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
      <code>
      class StarkFamily

        attr_reader :name, :age, :title

          def initialize(name, age, title)
            @name = name
            @age = age
            @title = title
          end
      end</code>
      </pre>
