        Let me start off by saying version control is awesome and it will be your best friend if you plan on getting involved with computer programming. So I guess that helps you understand that this is a bias blog post! Version control is how you keep track of any changes you make to a file, or even a folder. Anytime you add a new file to a directory(folder), change a header in the file, edit text/color etc., version control is going to keep a log of when these changes are made. That in itself should spell out a lot of obvious benefits! Since I'm a big gamer, I love the video game anology of a checkpoint.  Lets say you reach a point where a change you are making stops your code from working correctly. Think of version control, when used correctly as creating checkpoints, keeping track of your progress and allowing you and your team members to go back to a saved point when all the code was working correctly. Version control also makes it possible for multiple users to be working on the same code at the same time, without messing up each other's work. Once each person is done with their work, they can then submit it to the rest of the group, with the right commands, and once everything is approved it will all be saved to the master source code and everyone will be on the same page.  So there you go, version control is really just an awesome way to prevent errors, keep track of your changes/progress and allow you to share your work with other team members, without effecting their work directly. There are many types of version control software out there, but for our purposes here at Dev Bootcamp, we're using git.

          Git is used in your computer's command line. Once you are familiar with some of the basics with your command line, using git will become a lot easier.  There are numerous commands you will use in git to see the changes you have made you your files, but keep in mind git is always watching! Any change you make to a file and then save it will be stored in git. A popular perspective of how git works is like a tree. You can create "branches" of code that will not hurt the "trunk" or cource code until you tell it to. This is why git is so popularly used with prjects that involve a team. As a said before with version control in general, this way of keeping track of changes allows your whol group to work on the same project with getting in each other's way. Now git is used on your computer locally, so if your ahead of me by now, you are probably thinking IF THIS IS ALL ABOUT WORKING WITH A TEAM THEN HOW DO I SHARE THIS CODE??

          Great question!! You do it by using git to 'push' or send your work to GitHub which is where the rest of your team can see and review/approve the changes you have made locally on your computer. So essentially, you use git to make the changes on your own computer, then you send it out so it lives remotely on the internet for your team to finally see what you have changed. Once you've sent your work, your code is stored on guthub.com. This is also good practice not just so your team can view your work but you can view theirs and have the ability to pull it from GitHub back to git, synch or merge the changes with your current work and continue to make changes from there. Genius!
