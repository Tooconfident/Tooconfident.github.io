How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
- I really enjoyed the process.We did a good job splitting up the work where he was the driver during the wireframe developement and I took over during the html section.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
- Absolutely. It really gives a better undersstanding of the layour you desire for your page. I'm looking forward to learning how to style a page to look as close to the wireframe as possible.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
- We both liked a clean and structured outline. Ours was pretty simple. For a blog post we felt a clean basic structure with a section for the blog post and a section for related links to the post would be the main focus. 

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
- You'll see above, <section> <nav> and <article> were three new semantic elements both Wesley and I just learned during our session.
